# The Long Cold Way
A story-based game about guy names Joseph. He went in serious troubles in you up to find what faith is whaits for him.
Game is in **UNRELEASED** alpha-testing and under heavy development. This game will come in Acts (Episodes), so will take some time for each episode.
After some time (around 2 weeks after this readme) I probably will make trailer, but it might come out even after month.

Game built with TIC-80 Pro 1.0
You wont see any code here, this game isnt have readable open source code! This GitHub page is just for leaving your suggestion and, if you find any, bugs!

**The development is currently suspended. Wait for the future updates**
