# The-Long-Cold-Way
A story-based game about guy names Joseph. He went in serious troubles in you up to find what faith is whaits for him.
Game is in **UNRELEASED** alpha-testing and under heavy development. This game will come in Acts (Episodes), so will take some time for each episode.
The first Act will be free, the other **MIGHT** be **PAID**, so I wont leave code to change or play with it.
After some time (around 2 weeks after this readme) I probably will make trailer, but it might come out even after month.

Game built with TIC-80 Pro 1.0
You wont see any code here, this game isnt have readable open source code!
