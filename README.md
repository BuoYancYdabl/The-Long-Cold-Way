# The-Long-Cold-Way
A story-based game about guy names Joseph. He went in serious troubles in you up to find what faith is whaits for him.
Game is in **UNRELEASED** alpha-testing and under heavy development. This game will come in Acts (Episodes), so will take some time for each episode.
The first Act will be free, the other **MIGHT** be **PAID**, so I wont leave code to other acts to change or play with it.
The license will be MIT as the product is free and distributive-friendly, when the game will have 2 - 5 acts this license may change to another, the GitHub will contain only free version. You may buy more acts in future using my itch.io link. I'll try my best, to make this game worth to pay for. Also when game will become paid I'll cut or fully change all copyrighted content I may have right-now (intro storytelling mechanic idea, radio idea - Firewatch, phone idea - Silent Hill: Shattered Memories).
After some time (around 2 weeks after this readme) I probably will make trailer, but it might come out even after month.

Game built with TIC-80 Pro 1.0
You wont see any code here, this game isnt have readable open source code!
